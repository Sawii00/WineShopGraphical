# WineShop 

Assignment for the Lab of Software Engineering at UniPR. 

The goal was to write a Software Application in Java + JavaFX for the management of a Wine Shop. 

# Features:
- Allows the creation of users of different roles: admins (handle wine collection and other users), sellers (handle wine collection), and customers. 
- Customers can view the wines, their characteristics, and purchase them if available (otherwise, they can receive automatic notification upon restocking if requested)


# Demo:
In the demo folder, some pictures of the GUI are provided.
